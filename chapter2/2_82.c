/* problem:
 * We are running programs where values of type int are 32 bits. They are represented
 * in two's complement, and they are right shifted arithmetically. Values of
 * type unsigned are also 32 bits.
 * We generate arbitrary values x and y, and convert them to unsigned values as follows:
 *
 * // Create some arbitrary values
 * int x = random();
 * int y = random();
 * //Convert to unsigned
 * unsigned ux = (unsigned) x;
 * unsigned uy = (unsigned) y;
 *
 * For each of the following C expressions, you are to indicate whether ,or
 * not the expression always yields 1. If it always yields 1, describe the underlying
 * mathematical principles. Otherwise, give an example of arguments that make it
 * yield 0.
 *
 * A. (x<y) == (-x>-y)
 * B. ((x+y)<<4) + y-x == 17*y+15*x
 * C. ~x+~y+1 == ~(x+y)
 * D. (ux-uy) ==-(unsigned)(y-x)
 * E. ((x >> 2) << 2) <= x
